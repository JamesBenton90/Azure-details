# 🎓 Learning Azure the First Time – A Student’s Journey Using the Azure Portal ☁️

Hi there! 👋 I’m learning how to use **Microsoft Azure**, and I thought I’d document my process here — not just what I clicked, but what I was *thinking* along the way.

This is a beginner’s reflection on learning the basics of cloud computing using the **Azure Portal** — no scripts, no command line, just me, a browser, and lots of curiosity.

## 🧠 What I Knew (and Didn’t Know) at the Start

When I first logged in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com), I was overwhelmed. There were soooo many options!

I had heard about:
- 💻 **Virtual Machines** (VMs): kind of like renting a computer in the cloud
- 🗄️ **Storage Accounts**: a place to keep files, backups, and data
- 📁 **File Shares**: like a shared drive you can mount to a VM

But I wasn’t sure how they all fit together, or *why* I needed them.

## 🗂️ Step 1: Making a Resource Group (a place to hold everything)

I learned that a **Resource Group** is like a folder. Every VM, storage account, and network thing lives inside it. So I:

1. Went to the Portal
2. Searched for **“Resource groups”**
3. Clicked **+ Create**
4. Gave it a name like `MyLearningGroup` and picked a region

🧠 *What I learned:* You can delete the whole group later, which is great when you’re just testing things out!

## 💻 Step 2: Creating a Virtual Machine (my first cloud PC!)

Next up: I wanted to make a VM. I thought it would be hard — turns out, it’s mostly clicking!

1. I searched for **“Virtual machines”**
2. Clicked **+ Create** > **Azure virtual machine**
3. Chose:
   - Ubuntu for my image (I like Linux, but Windows would work too)
   - A small size (to avoid charges!)
   - My `MyLearningGroup` as the resource group
   - SSH login

I clicked through the tabs and hit **“Create”** — then waited a few minutes.

🚀 Suddenly, I had a **cloud-based computer** running!

I also have done a mock exam regarding Azure.
